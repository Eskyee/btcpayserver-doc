# How to contribute to BTCPay?

BTCPay Server is built and maintained entirely by volunteer contributors around the internet. We welcome and appreciate new contributions.

## Developers

If you're a developer looking to help, but you're not sure where to begin, check the [good first issue label](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), which contains small pieces of work that have been specifically flagged as being friendly to new contributors.

Contributors looking to do something a bit more challenging, before opening a pull request, please [create an issue](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/issues/new/choose) or join [our community chat](https://chat.btcpayserver.org/) to get early feedback, discuss best ways to tackle the problem and to ensure there is no work duplication.

We are actively looking for developers who can take on and resolve GitHub issues and help with development. If you would like to help us, but need some guidance,  [#dev channel on Mattermost](https://chat.btcpayserver.org/btcpayserver/channels/dev) is the place to ask questions. 

If you are interested in getting started as a developer or tester of the software, check out the [local development](LocalDevelopment.md) guide.

## Community

You can help BTCPay Server even if you're not a developer.

The easiest way is to use the software as a business or individual, provide feedback and [report any bugs or issues](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/issues) you or your customers encounter. Another great way is to join the [community](Community.md) and help others troubleshoot by sharing information you may have from your experience using BTCPay Server. 

## Translators & Documentation

[Translating](Translate.md) BTCPay Server, helping us with [documentation](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-doc/contribute-docs#contributing), making videos, writing articles on our [blog](http://blog.btcpayserver.org) and spreading the word are ways in which you can help, even if you're not a developer or tech-savvy.

## Hosting Providers

We need more VPS hosting providers to implement [1-Click BTCPay Server deployment](LunaNodeWebDeployment.md) and make the installation of software more accessible, decentralized and widely-available.
