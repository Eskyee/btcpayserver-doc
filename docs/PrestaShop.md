## 2. Pairing the store

BTCPay PrestaShop plugin is a **bridge between your server (payment processor) and your e-commerce store**.
No matter if you're using a self-hosted or third-party solution from step 2, the pairing process is identical.

1. In the `BTCPay server url`-field, enter the full URL of your host (including the https) â€“ https://btcpay.mydomain.com
2. Select the default transaction speed (this will change how much BTCPay recommends as transaction fee)
3. Select the relevant order mode for your store (order is created before or after payment)
4. Go to your BTCPay server, select a store, open its settings and select "Access Tokens".
5. Click on "Create a new token", select your store and then approve.
  5.1. You will see: "Server initiated pairing code: XXXX".
6. Enter your pairing code.
7. Press save. Prestashop will now attempt to make a connection with your BTCPayServer.
8. A message will be shown if the connection was successful.
9. It's recommended to do a test purchase.
